## Getting Started with `new-blocks`

This solution uses [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) (Inter Planetary File System) to securely store the user eKYC on the blockchain.
The user eKYC is encrypted using a privateKey and then the resulting data is stored onto the blockchain.
This key is shared among users when needm through the platform we've created.

This project was made using [Reactjs](reactjs.org)
